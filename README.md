help me

i could use some assistance with why things don't work â€” lol. Trying to learn some basic concepts.

With this file I'm trying to work with using different individual files to organize everything. the tutorial im going through said it's a good idea to put all of the #include's inside of a single .hpp file, then just link the main.cpp file to that one. I got it to work once, but when i tried applying the concept to this project it failed and idk why. Plz help me. I know practically a butt load of nothingness in this particulare area of study.

One love,
Bradley Reed Swords
