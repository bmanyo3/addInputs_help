help me

i could use some assistnace with why things don't work lol. trying to learn some basic concepts

with this file im trying to work with using different individual files to organize everything. the tutorial im going through said its a good idea to put all of the #include's inside of a single .hpp file, then just link the main.cpp file to that one. I got it to work once, but when i tried applying the concept to this project it failed and idk why. plz help
